# The Spotify Web Application
## Jonathan Phan, 5/13/2022

Spotify is one of the most well known and frequently used music streaming platforms. They have a vast library of songs, with some helpful playlist and song finding features. It isn't all sunshine and rainbows for Spotify, though, as they have been relatively infamous about their advertisements.

When first viewing the website, one sees a big bright banner immediately selling the user a product: Spotify Premium, in which it advertises 3 months of the premium service for free. But very clearly it is shown to the user that the premium service is first in the **visual heirarchy**, or the implied order of importance in visual information. At the very bottom of my screen, a 24 inch monitor running 1920x1080p resolution, there is the small heading of "SPOTIFY FREE". But the darker color of the blue background, and the text being in green which matches the blue more than the contrast between the white and purple of premium heading is yet another sign that the website wants to steer its users towards the paid product. 

Upon logging in to my account, through a relatively standard login screen with social authentication which I will not be showing for security purposes, as shown in the image below I am once again asked about Spotify Premium in a pop-up window that I have to actively close before listening to music.
