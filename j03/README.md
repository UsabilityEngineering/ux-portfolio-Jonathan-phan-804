# The Spotify Web Application
## Jonathan Phan, 5/13/2022

Spotify is one of the most well known and frequently used music streaming platforms. They have a vast library of songs, with some helpful playlist and song finding features. It isn't all sunshine and rainbows for Spotify, though, as they have been relatively infamous about their advertisements.

When first viewing the website, one sees a big bright banner immediately selling the user a product: Spotify Premium, in which it advertises 3 months of the premium service for free. But very clearly it is shown to the user that the premium service is first in the **visual heirarchy**, or the implied order of importance in visual information. At the very bottom of my screen, a 24 inch monitor running 1920x1080p resolution, there is the small heading of "SPOTIFY FREE". But the darker color of the blue background, and the text being in green which matches the blue more than the contrast between the white and purple of premium heading is yet another sign that the website wants to steer its users towards the paid product. 

Upon logging in to my account, through a relatively standard login screen with social authentication which I will not be showing for security purposes, as shown in the image below I am once again asked about Spotify Premium in a pop-up window that I have to actively close before listening to music. Another note is that I am opening it in an incognito tab, as I would usually be running an adblocker and it is a quick and easy way to get the most pure experience possible.

In light of finals week coming up, I have started to create a classical music playlist to study to, currently given the inspiring name of "My Playlist #3". We will go through the process of adding a new song to the playlist and listening to it. Pictured below is the current playlist, not far off the landing screen and with relatively easy access.

Speaking of the home screen, it shows things I have recently played, then a category of "Shows to try", several what appears to be podcasts that are entirely unrelated to the current endeavor, but may be of interest to some users. Next is a tab saying it is "Made for X", with what you have as your username in it. We can look here first for a new song for our playlist.

The listings here all appear to be playlists with minimal information. This lack of information can hurt the **efficiency** of my playlist creating process, because I am unsure what songs exactly are in each one, or even what type of music. Because the target is classical music, it is somewhat easier, and "Daily Mix 2" says something about the London Symphony Orchestra, which sounds like it might have some of what I want.

After clicking the link I arrive at the playlist, 50 songs of what appears to be classical music. The first piece on the list is *Mars, the Bringer of War*, by Gustav Holst, a song I am relatively familiar with and might be a good fit for my playlist. After listening to a short excerpt, I decide it might be alright, so I want to add it to my playlist. There is nothing immediate, but there are three dots on the song when hovered, which is common convention for a more options menu. Notably, these dots do not appear when I am not hovering the song, making this a **mystery meat menu**, where the existence of the menu itself is obscured and hard to see from the user's point of view. In this case, however, it is not as bad. Because there is no option immediately to add to a playlist, my natural instinct is to click on or hover the song to see more, in which the menu is presented.
