# The Beautiful Simplicity of Wordle
## Jonathan Phan, 2/25/22
Wordle is a popular word guessing game/app that was recently acquired by the *New York Times*, and demonstrates a beautifully clean and simple page, the usability of which helped propel it to its fame. Below is a screenshot of its initial look on desktop. Note that the mobile version looks almost completely identical.

As Wordle is a game, usability aspects such as **effectiveness** and **efficiency** are not very important. What is much more important is that the game is extremely **learnable** and **memorable**. For those unaware, Wordle is a game that limits its playing time to 6 guesses per word, one word per day. Because of this, it is important that either someone can easily understand how to play without much instruction or easily remember it after playing it once. Wordle accomplishes this through the use of **strong affordances**. A strong affordance is some aspect of a product that clearly indicates its intended means of use. Looking back to Figure 1, notice that without doing anything, a keyboard appears, and without numbers. It is a crystal clear indication that the player is meant to type in letters.
