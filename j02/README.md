# The Minecraft Installation Process
## Jonathan Phan, 4/15/22

Minecraft is one of the most popular and recognizable games, and recently a few friends and I have felt the urge to start playing it again, and started to install Minecraft again on our computers, many of us with new computers after some upgrades. Or, well... we tried to. I started by searching up "minecraft" into a search engine to find the website. So far, so good. On the site, there was a big green button that said "Get Minecraft". Before we get too into it, we need to talk about **conventions**. Through the entire experience, a major theme is the breaking of conventions in various, frustrating ways. A convention is just some generally accepted expectations about how things work. In this case, what conventions are there when hitting a big button that says "Get Product"? Before this, I would have answered that it would start downloading an installer, or perhaps get you to the installation page. That was not what Microsoft had in mind with the website. It instead brought us to another page that would find the installer. Almost. To my surprise, what I saw instead was:

It got us to the page to find the correct installer... in Japanese. Now, to be clear, some things may have affected this. A year ago, I had taken a class in Japanese, and had installed a Japanese language keyboard. However, that keyboard is not on this computer. Furthermore, testing it further, it does not take me to the Japanese page on an incognito tab, although the reasons why are unclear. This was a setback, but a somewhat minor one, as I noticed that in the url, the line for "en-us" changed to "ja-jp", and changing it there got me the page in the correct language. This, however, is a process that is not very **learnable**, especially to people who may be paying less attention to these detals. Furthermore, one of Minecraft's biggest audiences is children, so things should be designed to be as easily learnable as possible to ensure that either the child can comfortably install it, or a potentially bad with technology parent can get it for their child with little hassle. 

There is another way to change the locale. At the bottom of the page, there is a button that says "Japanese" in, well, Japanese. Clicking the language opens a **mystery meat menu** of options, all various languages to choose from. This menu is not at all obvious, and more can be done to suggest to any users that this is in fact a valid button or menu. The menu was so hidden that I had just found this button now, almost two weeks after finally getting Minecraft on my computer to find screenshots.

But the language swap was just the beginning. After this happened, there were a few chuckles and laughs, but I was still able to relatively make my way through. It is when the install process actually began when the real issues appeared. There was a wizard on the screen, asking which platform I wished to download for. I picked "computer", as I wanted to play on my computer. This does also break convention, as typically in gaming, when asking this question it will either say "PC" or "Windows", but the convention being broken is not a major issue in this case. It is still clear to me what it means, and referring to before, this is a lot better for the **learnability** aspect in regards to older parents or children who might be confused by the other labels. Then, it shows options for if I want to install the Java version or the Bedrock version, so I click Java, change the language again back to English, and finally there is a download button. So I click it, expecting finally to be able to install, and then it asks me to log in. This is fine, Minecraft is a game that you need to buy so I type in my account information and well of course it still does not work. My account, see, was a Mojang account because I am an old man and played Minecraft long before its acquisition by Microsoft. Now, Mojang accounts have been phased out and I have to convert the account into my Microsoft account. Fortunately, this process is relatively straightforward and only takes a few minutes to complete, involving for me two email verification codes because of my logging in from a new location. 

At this point, the process has been the opposite of **efficient**. Just getting the installer has taken close to an hour, significantly longer than the time I had anticipated actually doing the install. In fairness, some of the time was spent talking to my other friends who were going through this process, helping them out as well as making fun of the actual design elements involved. Well finally, I get taken to yet another page, this time with a download button saying "Download for Windows 10/11". At this point, this is the third download button I had clicked, and was cautiously optimistic, when finally "MinecraftInstaller.exe" begins downloading. We are finally in the home stretch, now just to run the installer and play some Minecraft. Just kidding that was the easy part. After running the installer and having it try to install files on my computer for around ten minutes, I get a new error message.
