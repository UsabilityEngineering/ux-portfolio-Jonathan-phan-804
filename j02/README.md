# The Minecraft Installation Process
## Jonathan Phan, 4/15/22

Minecraft is one of the most popular and recognizable games, and recently a few friends and I have felt the urge to start playing it again, and started to install Minecraft again on our computers, many of us with new computers after some upgrades. Or, well... we tried to. I started by searching up "minecraft" into a search engine to find the website. So far, so good. On the site, there was a big green button that said "Get Minecraft". Before we get too into it, we need to talk about **conventions**. Through the entire experience, a major theme is the breaking of conventions in various, frustrating ways. A convention is just some generally accepted expectations about how things work. In this case, what conventions are there when hitting a big button that says "Get Product"? Before this, I would have answered that it would start downloading an installer, or perhaps get you to the installation page. That was not what Microsoft had in mind with the website. It instead brought us to another page that would find the installer. Almost. To my surprise, what I saw instead was:

![Install page in Japanese](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72906410/163649944-689bd74a-044b-4c29-b7fc-15a0cb903cf4.png)

It got us to the page to find the correct installer... in Japanese. Now, to be clear, some things may have affected this. A year ago, I had taken a class in Japanese, and had installed a Japanese language keyboard. However, that keyboard is not on this computer. Testing it further, it does not take me to the Japanese page on an incognito tab, although the reasons why are unclear. This was a setback, but a somewhat minor one, as I noticed that in the url, the line for "en-us" changed to "ja-jp", and changing it there got me the page in the correct language. This, however, is a process that is not very **learnable**, especially to people who may be paying less attention to these detals. Furthermore, one of Minecraft's biggest audiences is children, so things should be designed to be as easily learnable as possible to ensure that either the child can comfortably install it, or a potentially bad with technology parent can get it for their child with little hassle. 

There is another way to change the locale. At the bottom of the page, there is a button that says "Japanese" in, well, Japanese. Clicking the language opens a **mystery meat menu** of options, all various languages to choose from. A "mystery meat menu" is a menu that is hidden behind a different interaction that might not be clearly lead to a menu. This menu is not at all obvious, and more can be done to suggest to any users that this is in fact a valid button or menu. The menu was so hidden that I had just found this button now, almost two weeks after finally getting Minecraft on my computer to find screenshots.

But the language swap was just the beginning. After this happened, there were a few chuckles and laughs, but I was still able to relatively make my way through. It is when the install process actually began when the real issues appeared. There was a wizard on the screen, asking which platform I wished to download for. I picked "computer", as I wanted to play on my computer. This does also break convention, as typically in gaming, when asking this question it will either say "PC" or "Windows", but the convention being broken is not a major issue in this case. It is still clear to me what it means, and referring to before, this is a lot better for the **learnability** aspect in regards to older parents or children who might be confused by the other labels. Then, it shows options for if I want to install the Java version or the Bedrock version, so I click Java, change the language again back to English, and finally there is a download button. So I click it, expecting finally to be able to install, and then it asks me to log in. This is fine, Minecraft is a game that you need to buy so I type in my account information and well of course it still does not work. My account, see, was a Mojang account because I am an old man and played Minecraft long before its acquisition by Microsoft. Now, Mojang accounts have been phased out and I have to convert the account into my Microsoft account. Fortunately, this process is relatively straightforward and only takes a few minutes to complete, involving for me two email verification codes because of my logging in from a new location. 

At this point, the process has been the opposite of **efficient**. Just getting the installer has taken close to an hour, significantly longer than the time I had anticipated actually doing the install. In fairness, some of the time was spent talking to my other friends who were going through this process, helping them out as well as making fun of the actual design elements involved. Well finally, I get taken to yet another page, this time with a download button saying "Download for Windows 10/11". At this point, this is the third download button I had clicked, and was cautiously optimistic, when finally "MinecraftInstaller.exe" begins downloading. We are finally in the home stretch, now just to run the installer and play some Minecraft. Just kidding that was the easy part. After running the installer and having it try to install files on my computer for around ten minutes, I get a new error message.

![Failed to install, install from Microsoft Store](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72906410/163649993-f46a2567-e6a6-47ef-a83d-20b4fdc7f6f2.png)

It seems like all of my struggles were for naught, and it was just a simple install from the famously good and stable Microsoft Store. Which again, is a divergence from convention where when I download a game from a website, I expect to get the game, not a message saying to download it from somewhere else instead. It is also a divergence from common sense to go through a long process for an installer which does not work, has no intention of working, but instead directs you towards a different installer on a different platform. In a now unsurprising twist, this of course did not work. Because, despite owning Minecraft and being guaranteed "Just one account for all Minecraft games", it said the launcher was in fact unavailable. After a bit of digging, this was because I first needed to install "Gaming Services". And this so called "Gaming Services", from the company that brought you XBox... straight up does not work. I was entirely not allowed to install this either, and judging from the reviews even if I could, it seems like it wouldn't help. During the initial install, there was exactly one positive review, with the title "Minecraft" and the body... "Minecraft". Since, there has been another. This is entirely off topic but it brought a smile to my face.

Well, we are in a conundrum, where we require Gaming Services to install Minecraft, but Gaming Services does not work so Minecraft still cannot be installed. Is this the end of the journey? Thankfully, it was not. In the reviews as well, there was a person who had seen it, and left some knowledge for travellers of the harsh Minecraft installation process, desperate for some oasis of knowledge. Go back to the final install webpage, and instead of downloading it for Windows 10/11, which is the operating system I am using, instead install it for Windows 7/8, which entirely bypasses the Microsoft store nonsense and just gives you access to the launcher itself. This violates some **mental models**, which describe how a user maps aspects of an application to reality. In this case, a user who has Windows 10 or 11 typically will expect that if they have a list of options with different versions that the one they should use and interact with is the one corresponding to the operating system they are using.

All in all, this was one of my worst ever user experience, at least in recent memory. Spending over an hour to install a file that is about 500 megabytes large is hilariously inefficient. It also was the opposite of learnable, jumping through several different hoops and having to just know that you should install a version of some software made for a different operating system is not something that immediately comes to mind. In fact, without prior instruction, it maybe would have been a last resort that I might have tried another day and see if I can run it on some compatability layer, but never as the first choice. All of this led to an incredibly **unsatisfying** experience. At the end of the process, none of my friends were in the mood to play Minecraft anymore, and the short amount of time we had to play with eachother after they get off work was already cut into so much we decided on something else instead. This is not to say that all breaking of convention is bad. But for anybody in the future, try to keep it on the same language and if there is an installation process, maybe 5 different buttons that say download but do not actually download any files is a bit excessive.
