# The Minecraft Installation Process
## Jonathan Phan, 4/15/22

Minecraft is one of the most popular and recognizable games, and recently a few friends and I have felt the urge to start playing it again, and started to install Minecraft again on our computers, many of us with new computers after some upgrades. Or, well... we tried to. I started by searching up "minecraft" into a search engine to find the website. So far, so good. On the site, there was a big green button that said "Get Minecraft". Before we get too into it, we need to talk about **conventions**. Through the entire experience, a major theme is the breaking of conventions in various, frustrating ways. A convention is just some generally accepted expectations about how things work. In this case, what conventions are there when hitting a big button that says "Get Product"? Before this, I would have answered that it would start downloading an installer, or perhaps get you to the installation page. That was not what Microsoft had in mind with the website. It instead brought us to another page that would find the installer. Almost. To my surprise, what I saw instead was:

![Install page in Japanese](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/ux-portfolio-Jonathan-phan-804/blob/master/assets/japanese_install.png)

It got us to the page to find the correct installer... in Japanese. Now, to be clear, some things may have affected this. A year ago, I had taken a class in Japanese, and had installed a Japanese language keyboard. However, that keyboard is not on this computer. Furthermore, testing it further, it does not take me to the Japanese page on an incognito tab, although the reasons why are unclear. This was a setback, but a somewhat minor one, as I noticed that in the url, the line for "en-us" changed to "ja-jp", and changing it there got me the page in the correct language. This, however, is a process that is not very **learnable**, especially to people who may be paying less attention to these detals. Furthermore, one of Minecraft's biggest audiences is children, so things should be designed to be as easily learnable as possible to ensure that either the child can comfortably install it, or a potentially bad with technology parent can get it for their child with little hassle.
